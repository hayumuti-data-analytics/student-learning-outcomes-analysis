# Student Learning Outcomes Analysis

## Project Overview
This project presents an Excel-based analysis of undergraduate student learning outcomes using real-world–like assessment data. The objective is to demonstrate an end-to-end educational data analysis workflow, from raw data to actionable insights, suitable for academic and institutional decision-making.

## Research Questions
- How do students perform across different assessment components (quizzes, assignments, final exam)?
- What is the overall distribution of student achievement?
- Which assessment components contribute most to final learning outcomes?

## Data Description
- Dataset: Student assessment records of 27 undergraduate students
- Source: Simulated academic assessment data (for portfolio purposes)
- Format: PDF (raw data), Excel (processed and analyzed)

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning & Restructuring**
   - Standardized student names and IDs
   - Checked for missing and inconsistent values
2. **Data Transformation**
   - Calculated total scores and weighted final grades using Excel formulas
3. **Aggregation & Analysis**
   - Used Pivot Tables to summarize performance by assessment component
4. **Visualization**
   - Built an interactive dashboard in Excel for performance monitoring

## Deliverables
- Raw dataset (PDF)
- Processed and analyzed Excel file with formulas, pivots, and dashboard
- Insight sheet summarizing key findings

## Key Insights
- Most students achieved satisfactory performance across continuous assessments.
- Final exam scores showed the highest variability.
- Aggregated results indicate assessment balance is critical to overall outcomes.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (formulas, pivot tables, dashboard)

## Notes
This project is designed as a professional portfolio artifact to demonstrate analytical thinking, data literacy, and applied educational research skills.
